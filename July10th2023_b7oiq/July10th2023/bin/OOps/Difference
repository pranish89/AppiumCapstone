overLoading - 

1. It happens in single class itself

2. Same method signature but differs in the argument

3. We can do over-loading with static methods and constructors

4. It happens with static methods

5. method calls get attached with the method body (Binding), so it happens during compilation time.

6. Compilation time polymorphism

7. Inheritance is not required

overRiding - 

1. It happens over multiple classes.

2. Same method signature exists but differs in implementation.

3. We can not override static methods and constructors

4. It always happens with non-static methods

5. Binding happens during execution phase, why --> because objects are needed for overriding and 
they get created during execution phase only.

6. Run-time polymorphism.

7. 7. Inheritance is must.
